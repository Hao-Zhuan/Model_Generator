# Model Generator

Model Generator is a repository designed to automate the creation of test cases for PyTorch operations. It dynamically generates PyTorch models based on a provided JSON configuration, which specifies the operation name, input count, output count, attributes, and possible input shapes.

The generated models, saved in both PyTorch and ONNX formats, can be used to verify the correctness of PyTorch operation implementations, facilitating rigorous testing and quality assurance in machine learning and deep learning projects.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Model Generation**: Models are dynamically generated based on user-provided JSON configurations.

- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Generated models can be saved in either PyTorch or ONNX formats for testing in different environments.

- **Quality Assurance**: The autogenerated test cases can effectively verify the correctness of PyTorch operation implementations, ensuring the quality of the project.
