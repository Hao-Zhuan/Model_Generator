Model_generator is a repository designed to automate the creation of test cases for PyTorch operations. It dynamically generates PyTorch models based on a provided JSON configuration, which specifies the operation name, input count, output count, attributes, and possible input shapes. The generated models, saved in both PyTorch and ONNX formats, can be used to verify the correctness of PyTorch operation implementations, facilitating rigorous testing and quality assurance in machine learning and deep learning projects.
